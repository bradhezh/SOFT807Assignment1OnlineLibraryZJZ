Please note:
  This application uses MongoDB, which is a No-SQL database, so there is no SQL script provided. Instead, there is a migration script (migrate.js in the project root directory) written in JavaScript provided, which will run automatically when the application starts after deployment. The migration script can also be executed manually after the DB_URL environment variable has been set correctly. If there is no user in the users collection (table), the migration script will create the initial 'admin' user with the initial password '88888888', as well as some sample data.
